Welcome to my personal blog, which I set up for the sole purpose of answering all those *"Awesome idea, how can I build one myself?"* questions with a simple link instead of a lengthy description.
Just kidding, I mostly get raised eyebrows and a friendly *"Nerd!"* when I brag about my projects. This is mostly a repository for myself so that I don't forget what I was thinking if I have to repair any of these things in the future.

My name is Lasse, I am a student at RWTH Aachen University, currently doing my M.Sc. Computer Science. While studying, I also have a side job as a software engineer. As if that wasn't enough to call me a full blown geek, I also enjoy coding and tinkering with microcontrollers in my free time (among other things. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via keybase (my name is gasp0de) or email me at my domain name (without .de) @gmail.com. If you build any of the things based on these descriptions, I would be happy to receive pictures of them!
